# pass-the-pigs üêñüêñ

A silly retro game of pass the pigs, currently living [on satirical anachronistic news website the Hillgrove Files](https://thehillgrovefiles.com/classifieds/).

Pass the pigs is an asymmetrical dice game in which players race to 100 points. The rules of the game are outline on [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_Pigs).

Probabilities are based on John C. Kern's [paper on the subject](https://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/datasets.kern.html).

This game was written in vanilla JavaScript, css and html. Pig graphics were provided by Jon D'Alton. Arial fonts were borrowed from [Win95.css](https://alexbsoft.github.io/win95.css/) while Comset Bold came from [here](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1463221/comset-2).
